## Title and Description
Challenge 10 for UNCC Coding Bootcamp.

In this challenge we were tasked with creating a node.js application that asks for user input with regard to entering different classes of employees using the inquirer object. 

Once the user input is collected the app will generate an html file with cards representing each employee entered.

To run the application you will go to the Challenge 10 directory once downloded and run the integrated terminal. Run "node index" and enter in the sample data. Once complete a index.html file will appear in your file explorer.

Saturday officehours also helped watching the recording to help with the sending of data with the fs.writefile method.

## Tests
    All tests were seeing if the file created the Manager, Engineer, Intern and Employee object
